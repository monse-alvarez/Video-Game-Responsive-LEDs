# Video-Game-Responsive-LEDs
This program was made for terraria but can be adjusted for any video game. The python program reads the player's health and sends the data over a serial port. I used a PSoC6 to read the data from the serial port and turn on different LEDs based on the data. I also created a BLE service to allow the user to turn on the LEDs with a phone using the AIROC application. For the window capture python program, I used @LearnCodeByGaming tutorials on Youtube. For the PSoC I used @CypressSemi tutorials on Youtube
